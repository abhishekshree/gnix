# gnix

Wrote some basic UNIX Commands while learning about go, also did learn how to write Makefiles.

To list them, this repository has implementations of -
- cat
- cp
- dirname
- echo
- ls
- mkdir
- pwd
- sleep
- touch
- whoami
- grep (basic search)

One can use the ```build.sh``` file to build all the files and store in the ```./build``` folder.

### Update

You can also use ```make``` to build the files.
